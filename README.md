# VLSI-Testing-Tool
Designed a VLSI Testing tool using C++.

## Getting Started
The aim of this project is to create a VLSI simulation and test tool that detects if the circuit is faulty. If it is, test vectors are generated that detect all the faults.

### Prerequisites
Visual Studio/ Visual Studio Code

### Project Phases
#### Fault-free Circuit Simulation
  Here the logical output at each gate of the VLSI circuit are generated. Each gate instantiation stores its respective output.
#### Simulate the Circuit to store all possible faults
  This phase simulates the circuit and returns a list of all possible faults at each
